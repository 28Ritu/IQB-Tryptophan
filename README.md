# IQB-Tryptophan

## Course: Introduction to Quantitative Biology (IQB)

#### Objective:
    1. Generate plots for tryptophan production ignoring feedback regulation through tryp-trypR binding under low and high tryptohan concentration levels respectively.
    2. Generate plots for tryptophan production including feedback regulation through tryp-trypR binding under low and high tryptohan concentration levels respectively.
    3. Generate plots for the mRNA production levels as afunction of intracellular tryptophan level (to check if tryptophan operon functions as a genetic switch).
